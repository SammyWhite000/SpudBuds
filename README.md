THIS IS THE IMPORTANT ONE I WROTE IT THREE TIMES SO EVERYONE DOES IT

 in root, copy a version of fuel into fuelSB. This is the one we will be using for the project

if not i dont think your fuel will work.

Ok!! So this is what I learned from logan.

1. put m1 in your cs312 in local_html

2. I wrote the correct path in index.php notice the extra directory and how it is from fuelSB not fuel. This is WHY U NEED TO COPY A fuelSB in your root.

3. fuelSB permissions (in root): 711
   m1 permissions (in local_html): 755 
   I don't understand why, maybe a good question for logan.

4. the grading path to the website is not super strict. logan said if you have the correct path in a comment when you sumbit it will be fine.

5. if you are like me and don't understand why/what fuel STILL IS (smh you thought i would have) logan said to watch the mod 6 lectures and do the mod 6 & 7 labs

will let you guys know if i make more changes!!
