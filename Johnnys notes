It is looking like we don't need fuel as all the files that we need are in fuelSB.
I suggest that we delete fuel.

In addition, I worked on the template, bios, home/index, and the css

Please take a look into my branch to see the edits that I have made

The instructions say that we need a logo. I don't know what exactly what we would want as our logo.

For the css, i chose random colors but it doesn't feel like our vibe. I was just seeing what the colors and 
    placement for the items would look like.
