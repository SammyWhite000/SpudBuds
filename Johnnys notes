It is looking like we don't need fuel as all the files that we need are in fuelSB.
I suggest that we delete fuel.

In addition, I worked on the template, bios, home/index, and the css

Please take a look into my branch to see the edits that I have made

The instructions say that we need a logo. I don't know what exactly what we would want as our logo.

For the css, i chose random colors but it doesn't feel like our vibe. I was just seeing what the colors and 
    placement for the items would look like. 

Spoke to Logan on 3/23/22, the bash script gitcp is to fix the fuel folder issues that we were having. Logan
said that our folder config was too many folders in and to use gitcp to fix the issues.
