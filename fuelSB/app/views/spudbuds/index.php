    <h2> Group 14 </h2>
    <p> SpudBuds collaborated during the Spring 2022 semester for the color coordinate generation project.
        SpudBuds took approximately 10 weeks to finish this project. SpudBuds is built using FuelPHP templates and
        hard work. 
    </p>
    <p> Color Coordinate generation is a fancy way of saying that we will be essentially be building
        a mosaic table based on user input for size and the colors that will be used. This
        mosaic table will then be used in vision therapy.
    </p>

        The color coordinate generation for vision therapy can be found in the Mosaic tab.
